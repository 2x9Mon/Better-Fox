# Better Fox: v.74
A set of digestable preferences lists to enhance Firefox. Updated every stable release. Just comb through the lists and add desired preferences to your <a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/User.js_file">user.js</a>. Most of the preferences work with a simple copy+paste. I've tried to note where user manipulation may be needed.

Four categories:
1) FastFox: increase Firefox's browsing speed immensely.
2) CleanFox: removes Pocket and form autofill. Download preferences. Unclutters about:newtab.
3) PeskyFox: dark mode. Disable warnings. Blocks notification by default. Prevent Firefox from randomly going offline.
4) SecureFox: removes Telemetry, Google Safe Browsing, Geolocation, search engine suggestions in URL bar, and various security enhancements â€” all without breaking webpages by default!
