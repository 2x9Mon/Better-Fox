# BetterFox /v.74
A set of digestable preferences lists to enhance Firefox.
Updated every stable release. Just comb through the lists and add desired preferences to your <a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/User.js_file">user.js</a>. Most of the preferences work with a simple copy+paste. I've tried to note where user manipulation may be needed.

## Three simple categories:
1) <b>FastFox:</b> increase Firefox's browsing speed immensely.
2) <b>PeskyFox:</b> dark mode by default. Disable warnings. Removes Pocket and form autofill. Prevent Firefox from randomly going offline and serving annoying webpage notifications. Adjusts download preferences. Unclutters about:newtab.
3) <b>SecureFox:</b> removes Telemetry, Google Safe Browsing, geolocation, search engine suggestions in URL bar, and adds various security enhancements â€” all without breaking webpages. You read that right. No breakage :)
